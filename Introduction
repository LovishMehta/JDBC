JDBC refers to Java Data Base Connectivity
To connect java application with the Database we require connectivity and the concept of connecting java with the database is called JDBC.
JDBC is a Java API to connect and execute the query with the database.
So whenever you want to connect java with the database you require driver

There are four types of JDBC drivers:
-> JDBC-ODBC Bridge Driver,
-> Native Driver,
-> Network Protocol Driver, and
-> Thin Driver

We can use JDBC API to access tabular data stored in any relational database. By the help of JDBC API, we can save, update, delete and fetch data from the database.

1) Import the package (java.sql.*)
2) Load and Register the Driver
   a) Load (the driver)
   b) Register (Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbcDriver")
3) Establish the Connection  (Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection("URL","UserName","Password")) //Connection is an interface
4) Create the statement -> Statement (Statement st = con.cretaeStatement;) //Statement is an interface 
                        -> Prpeared Statement
                        -> Collable Statement
5) Establish the Query (Result rs = st.executeQuery("Select * from student");      //quesry is for fetching the value
6) Process Result     (while(rs.next()){
                       sout(rs.getInt(1)+" "+rs.getString(2)); } )
7) Close              st.close()
                      con.close()
                      
In Sql we have
1) DDL: whenever we create strucuture of a table that's DDL
2) DML: whenever you want to insert and delete the values it's manuplation(DML)
3) DQL: whenever we want to fire the query for fetching the values there's DQL
